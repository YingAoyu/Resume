<h1>Something about my experience</h1>
<h2>This is a simple statement of my resume</h2>
<p>I have many advantages. I am patient and can spend a lot of time on one thing. I am also very careful and can often avoid many small mistakes. I can finish my studies seriously and have a strong sense of responsibility. But I also have many shortcomings. I often don't accept others' opinions with an open mind, stubbornly hold my own opinions, and sometimes I'm rude</p>
<p>Part of this meteoric rise can be attributed to the impressively soaring ad dollars being pumped into the Women's World Cup games in 2014. The women's games generated $40 million for Fox, that's definitely not chump change. And those advertisers,
like ATT, Coca Cola, Verizon, Nike, Visa, and other heavy hitters, are working to make sure they see those numbers grow year after year by investing in youth soccer facilities and promoting programs across the country. </p>
<p>I will look directly at my shortcomings. When talking to others, I will first make psychological preparations for myself. Every time, I will tell myself to respect and learn from others. I often restrain my recklessness and make myself better. Because of my advantages, I have good conditions in doing things. I like to do things alone and can do well </p>
<p>This is a brief description of me</p>
